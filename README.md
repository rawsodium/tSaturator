# tSaturator - a Vintage Tape Saturation Plugin

### by Deanna Turner, for MUST4611 (Music Technology Capstone) at Northeastern University
tSaturator (pronounced “saturator”) is a VST/AU tape saturation plugin built with the JUCE C++ framework. The interface allows users to control the amount of saturation, the drive of the signal applied before saturation, the wet/dry mix, and the amount of hiss. tSaturator also includes a spectrum analyzer, allowing users to see what the plugin is doing to their audio in real time.
